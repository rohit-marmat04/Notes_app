Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code.

## What is a Token?

A **token** is a sequence of characters that can be treated as a **unit** in the grammar of a programming language.

### Categories of Tokens

1. **Keywords**  
   Reserved words with specific meanings used to define the language's structure.  
   - Examples in C: `if`, `else`, `for`, `void`  
   - Cannot be used as variable names or identifiers.  
   - C has a total of **32 keywords**.

2. **Identifiers**  
   Names for variables, functions, arrays, or other user-defined items.  
   - Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).  
   - Can include letters, digits, and underscores.  
   - Case-sensitive (`a` ≠ `A`).  
   - Cannot be the same as keywords.

3. **Constants**  
   Fixed values that **cannot change** during program execution, also called literals.  
   - Types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings.

4. **Operators**  
   Symbols that perform actions on variables or other data items (operands).  
   - Examples: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `==`

5. **Special Symbols**  
   Symbols used for specific purposes in code structure or operations.  
   - Examples:  
     - `;` → End statements  
     - `,` → Separate values  
     - `{}` → Code blocks  
     - `[]` → Arrays

## What is a Lexeme?

A **lexeme** is the actual string of characters that matches a pattern and generates a token.  

**Examples:**  
`float`, `abs_zero_Kelvin`, `=`, `-`, `273`, `;`

## Lexemes and Tokens Representation

| Lexeme | Token        | Lexeme            | Token        |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| while  | WHILE       | a               | IDENTIFIER  |
| (      | LAPREN      | =               | ASSIGNMENT  |
| a      | IDENTIFIER  | a               | IDENTIFIER  |
| >=     | COMPARISON  | -               | ARITHMETIC  |
| b      | IDENTIFIER  | 2               | INTEGER     |
| )      | RPAREN      | ;               | SEMICOLON   |

## How Lexical Analyzer Works

- Tokens in a programming language can be described using **regular expressions**.  
- A **scanner** or **lexical analyzer** uses a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** to recognize these tokens.  
- Each **final state** of the DFA corresponds to a specific token type, allowing the scanner to classify the input.  
- Creating a DFA from regular expressions can be automated, making token recognition efficient.

### Error Detection

- The lexical analyzer identifies errors based on the DFA and language grammar (e.g., C, C++).  
- It provides the **row and column number** of the error.

### Example

Consider the statement:

```c
a = b + c;
