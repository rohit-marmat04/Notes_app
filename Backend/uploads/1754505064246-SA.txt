Syntax Analysis (also known as parsing) is the step after Lexical Analysis. The Lexical analysis breaks source code into tokens.

Tokens are inputs for Syntax Analysis.
The goal of Syntax Analysis is to interpret the meaning of these tokens.
It checks whether the tokens produced by the lexical analyzer are arranged according to the language's grammar.
The syntax analyzer attempts to build a Parse Tree or Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the program's structure.
