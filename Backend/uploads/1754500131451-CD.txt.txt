Lexical analysis, also known as scanning is the first phase of a compiler which involves reading the source program character by character from left to right and organizing them into tokens. Tokens are meaningful sequences of characters. There are usually only a small number of tokens for a programming language including constants (such as integers, doubles, characters, and strings), operators (arithmetic, relational, and logical), punctuation marks and reserved keywords.
